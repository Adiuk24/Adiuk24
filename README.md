# 👋 Hi, I’m Arif Ahmed Adito (@Adiuk24)

Founder-minded technologist building **secure, scalable platforms** for real-world use.  
I focus on **OTT systems, content protection, and production-grade web platforms**.

I care less about demos — and more about **systems that actually run in production**.

---

## 🚀 What I Build
- Enterprise-grade **platforms & backend systems**
- **Anti-piracy & content protection** for live streaming
- Scalable **APIs & microservices**
- Deployment-ready infrastructure (cloud & containers)
- Clean, maintainable systems teams can trust

---

## 🛠 Tech I Actually Use
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI  
- **Frontend:** JavaScript / TypeScript  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Alembic  
- **DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose, AWS  
- **Workflow:** GitHub Actions, Makefiles, Pre-commit

## 🧩 How I Think
- Product-first, not tool-first  
- Systems > scripts  
- Documentation is part of the product  
- Security and scale are not optional  
- Code should help teams move faster, not slower
